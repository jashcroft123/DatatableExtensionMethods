# Why
I get a lot of datatables that are returned from sql queries. To remove the requirement to have to map a lookup to a property I reflect in to the given class and then attempt to find a matching column name in the datatable

# Future Improvements
- Add comments
- Improve Error Handling
- Look to create datarow extension methods to remove the requirement of the datatable only being one row long
